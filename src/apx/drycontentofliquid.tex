\chapter{Dry Content of a Liquid}
\label{sec:drycontentofliquid}
It is often useful to know the dry weight of materials in liquid clay slips or 
glazes. This can be done with Brogniart's Formula.

First find the weight of 1 liter of the liquid. The density (specific gravity, 
g/cm$^3$) of the dry material has to be known. For clay materials it is close 
to 2.5. Density of glazes has to be calculated from the density of the
materials in the glaze recipe.

$Dry~weight~in~g=((W-1000)*D)/(D-1)$

Where:

$W$ = weight in g of 1 liter liquid

$D$ = density of dry material
