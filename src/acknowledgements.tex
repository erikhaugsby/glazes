\subsection*{Typesetting}
This document was typeset by Erik Haugsby from the source material provided 
via the CD3WD:
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document attempts to replicate the source material and present it in a 
more accessible structure.

As the source material is freely available online and the cost of a print 
version of this text is prohibitively high, I believe this document is an 
important contribution to the collective knowledge of potters. 

It improves upon the HTML version of the information by consolidating all 
sections into a single document, which is both viewable on the computer and can 
also be printed. Furthermore, it introduces clickable links/references between 
sections, tables, and images.

\subsection*{Formatting: Changes, Errors, Omissions}
I have attempted to preserve the original text and formatting. 

Some changes to formatting, especially of tables, was unavoidable due to the 
LaTeX typesetting.

Some corrections were made to spelling and grammar.

The possibility of minor or unavoidable changes in layout and formatting, as 
well as unintentional errors in transcribing the original text, cannot be 
excluded.

Should you find any errors or omissions, I would greatly appreciate you either 
notifying me \href{mailto:e@erikhaugsby.com}{by email}, or initiating a pull 
request via Git.

\subsection*{Henrik Norsker} 
Henrik Norsker has been making pottery since 1970. He left his 
pottery workshop in Denmark in 1976 to establish a pottery school in a village 
in Tanzania. Since then he has continued working in developing countries with 
promotion of small scale ceramics industries. Besides Tanzania he has been 
employed in ceramics projects in Burma, Bangladesh and Nepal.

\subsection*{James Danisch} 
James Danisch has been making, selling and experimenting with 
ceramics since 1963. He has taught college level ceramics in Scotland and 
California, and has conducted workshops in the US, South America and Canada. 
From 1984 to 1992, he has been working with small scale and rural ceramics 
development in Nepal. His articles on ceramics have been published in several 
magazines, and he has studied traditional and he has studied traditional and

\subsection*{The Deutsches Zentrum f\"{u}r Entwicklungstechnologien}
Deutsches Zentrum f\"{u}r Entwicklungstechnologien-GATE

Deutsches Zentrum f\"{u}r Entwicklungstechnologien--GATE--stands for German 
Appropriate Technology Exchange. It was founded in 1978 as a special division 
of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\"{u}r Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH. GATE 
is a 
centre for the dissemination and promotion of appropriate technologies for 
developing countries. GATE defines ``Appropriate technologies'' as those which 
are suitable and acceptable in the light of economic, social and cultural 
criteria. They should contribute to socio-economic development whilst ensuring 
optimal utilization of resources and minimal detriment to the environment. 
Depending on the case at hand a traditional, intermediate or highly-developed 
can be the ``appropriate'' one. GATE focusses its work on the key areas:
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
\item Dissemination of Appropriate Technologies: 

Collecting, processing and disseminating information on technologies 
appropriate to the needs of the developing countries: ascertaining the 
technological requirements of Third World countries: support in the form of 
personnel, material and equipment to promote the development and adaptation of 
technologies for developing countries.

\item Environmental Protection:

The growing importance of ecology and environmental protection require better 
coordination and harmonization of projects. In order to tackle these tasks more 
effectively, a coordination center was set up within GATE in 1985.
\end{itemize}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATE has entered into cooperation agreements with a number of technology 
centres in Third World countries.

GATE offers a free information service on appropriate technologies for all 
public and private development institutions in developing countries, dealing 
with the development, adaptation, introduction and application of technologies.
