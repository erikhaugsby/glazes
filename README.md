A LaTeX typsetting of the book "Glazes - for the Self-reliant Potter"

Norsker, Henrik, and James Danisch. Glazes - for the Self-reliant Potter: A Publication of Deutsches Zentrum Für Entwicklungstechnologien - GATE, a Division of the Deutsche Gesellschaft Für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH. Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1993.

DOI: 10.1007/978-3-663-06865-5
ISBN: 9783663068655 (online) 9783528020675 (print)

This document was typeset in LaTex by Erik Haugsby from the source material provided 
via the CD3WD:

As the source material is freely available online, the cost of a print version of
this text is prohibitively high, I believe this document is an important contribution to 
the collective knowledge of potters. As far as I know, it is also the first time that
some of the appendixes, for example the tables of cones and their temperature
equivalents, is available in LaTeX.

I have attempted to preserve the original text and formatting. Some changes to 
formatting, especially of tables, was unavoidable due to the LaTeX typesetting.
The possibility of minor or unavoidable changes in layout and formatting, as well 
as unintentional errors in transcribing the original text, cannot be excluded.

Should you find any errors or omissions, I would greatly appreciate you either 
notifying me by email (e@erikhaugsby.com), or initiating a pull 
request via Git.
