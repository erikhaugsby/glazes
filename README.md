## Scope and Purpose

This document attempts to replicate the source material and present it in a more 
accessible structure.

As the source material is freely available online and the cost of a print version 
of this text is prohibitively high, I believe this document is an important 
contribution to the collective knowledge of potters. 

It improves upon the HTML version of the information by consolidating all sections 
into a single document, which is both viewable on the computer and can also be
printed. Furthermore, it introduces clickable links/references between sections, 
tables, and images.

It is also the first time (as far as I am aware) that information in some of the 
appendices, for example the tables of cones and their temperature equivalents, 
is publically available in LaTeX-format tables.

## Potential Errors, Omissions

I have attempted to preserve the original text and formatting. 

Some changes to formatting, especially of tables, was unavoidable due to the 
LaTeX typesetting.

Some corrections were made to spelling and grammar.

The possibility of minor or unavoidable changes in layout and formatting, as 
well as unintentional errors in transcribing the original text, cannot be 
excluded.

- [ ] 3: Elements Oxides
- [ ] 4: Common Materials
- [ ] 5: Chemical Analysis of Materials
- [ ] 6: Standard Sieves
- [ ] 7: Seger Cone Formulas
- [x] 8: Seger Cone Temperature Equivalents
- [x] 9: Orton Cone Temperature Equivalents
- [x] 10: Conversion Pint US/UK
- [x] 11: Density
- [x] 12: Dry Content of Liquid
- [x] 13: Twaddell Scale
- [x] 14: Properties of Fuel
- [ ] 15: Metric System
