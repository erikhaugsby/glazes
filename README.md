## Typesetting

This document was typeset in LaTex by Erik Haugsby from the source material 
provided via the CD3WD:

http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/CD3WD/APPRTECH/G17GLE/EN/B483.HTM

I lay no claim to ownership of the content.

## Source Materials

As the source material is freely available online & the cost of a print version 
of this text is prohibitively high, I believe this document is an important 
contribution to the collective knowledge of potters. 

As far as I know, it is also the first time that information from some of the 
appendices, for example the tables of cones and their temperature equivalents, 
is publically available in a LaTeX format.

I have attempted to preserve the original text and formatting. Some changes to 
formatting, especially of tables, was unavoidable due to the LaTeX typesetting.
The possibility of minor or unavoidable changes in layout and formatting, as 
well as unintentional errors in transcribing the original text, cannot be 
excluded.

- [ ] 3: Elements Oxides
- [ ] 4: Common Materials
- [ ] 5: Chemical Analysis of Materials
- [ ] 6: Standard Sieves
- [ ] 7: Seger Cone Formulas
- [x] 8: Seger Cone Temperature Equivalents
- [x] 9: Orton Cone Temperature Equivalents
- [x] 10: Conversion Pint US/UK
- [x] 11: Density
- [x] 12: Dry Content of Liquid
- [x] 13: Twaddell Scale
- [x] 14: Properties of Fuel
